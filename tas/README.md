# Tas — ESP32-S3 Controller Firmware

ESP32-S3 firmware for the [NeatAmpTAS3251](../README.md) Class-D amplifier
board: a C++ class-based driver stack (see
[Firmware Architecture](#firmware-architecture) below) that sequences the
power rails, brings the TAS3251 out of reset, configures it over I2C, and
monitors /FAULT, /CLIP_OTW and the 13.2V rail — see
[ESP32-S3 Hardware IO](#esp32-s3-hardware-io) for the underlying pin map.

This firmware targets the ESP32-S3 only — the board and this project are not
built for any other Espressif chip.

## Installing ESP-IDF (macOS, command line)

ESP-IDF is installed with the ESP-IDF Installation Manager (`eim`). The
command-line `eim` is more reliable than the GUI app, which ignores the shell
`PATH` and may fail to find a suitable Python.

**Prerequisite — Python 3.10 to 3.13.** `eim` runs a Python sanity check and
refuses to install with anything outside that range. Homebrew's default
`python3` may be newer (e.g. 3.15) and will fail with `[FAIL] Python Version`.
Install a supported version alongside it and put it first on the `PATH` for the
shell used to run `eim`:

```sh
brew install python@3.13 espressif/eim/eim
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.13/libexec/bin:$PATH
python3 --version   # must print 3.13.x
```

Use `libexec/bin`, not `bin`: only `libexec/bin` provides the unversioned
`python3`/`python` names that `eim` looks up. `eim` itself only needs to be
reachable from that shell, so the default `python3` does not have to be changed
system-wide.

Then install ESP-IDF for the ESP32-S3 (this clones ESP-IDF and downloads the
toolchains into `~/.espressif`, several GB; run it from a scratch directory
because `eim` can drop an `eim_config.toml` into the current directory):

```sh
eim install -n true -t esp32s3 -i v6.1
```

When it finishes it prints the activation command, which is used in each new
shell (see [Local setup](#local-setup)):

```sh
source ~/.espressif/tools/activate_idf_v6.1.sh
```

Verified: `idf.py set-target esp32s3 && idf.py build` completes on ESP-IDF
6.1 with this setup.

## Local setup

The repository uses a local Python virtual environment for project-side Python
commands. Create it once from the project directory:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Initialize the ESP-IDF toolchain in each new shell. This sets `IDF_PATH`, adds
`idf.py` to `PATH`, and selects the ESP-IDF tools and its compatible managed
Python environment required by the build:

```sh
source ~/.espressif/tools/activate_idf_v6.1.sh
```

This script is created by `eim` (see
[Installing ESP-IDF](#installing-esp-idf-macos-command-line)); ESP-IDF itself
lives in `~/.espressif/v6.1/esp-idf`. Adjust the version in the file name if
you installed a different one.

Run the ESP-IDF commands after activation; ESP-IDF may replace the active
`.venv` interpreter with its managed environment so all ESP-IDF dependencies
match the installed ESP-IDF release.

Select the target and build:

```sh
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
```

The generated `build/compile_commands.json` is used by clangd and C/C++
IntelliSense. Keeping the project build configured ensures ESP-IDF headers
such as `esp_system.h` and `esp_flash.h` resolve without missing-include
warnings.

`sdkconfig.defaults` sets the flash size (8 MB) and PSRAM (8 MB **Octal**) to
match the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U-N8R8 module actually used on this board. Octal
PSRAM claims GPIO35/36/37 (module pins 28/29/30) internally — see
[Reserved pins](#reserved-pins-do-not-use) below.

> **Existing `sdkconfig` after pulling the Octal PSRAM change:**
> `sdkconfig.defaults` only seeds a *new* `sdkconfig`; an existing one keeps
> `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MODE_QUAD=y`. Either delete `sdkconfig` and run
> `idf.py reconfigure`, or set *Component config → ESP PSRAM → SPI RAM
> config → Mode (QUAD/OCT) of SPI RAM chip in use* to **Octal Mode PSRAM**
> in menuconfig. Check with `grep SPIRAM_MODE sdkconfig`.

If a
fresh `sdkconfig` ever comes up as 2 MB flash / no PSRAM again (check the
boot log — see
[Chip and firmware info logging](#chip-and-firmware-info-logging) — or
`grep CONFIG_SPIRAM sdkconfig`), run `idf.py reconfigure`; if it's still
missing, confirm `esp_psram` is still in `main`'s `PRIV_REQUIRES` in
`main/CMakeLists.txt` — this project builds with `MINIMAL_BUILD ON`
(root `CMakeLists.txt`), which silently drops `CONFIG_SPIRAM` from the
Kconfig tree entirely if nothing depends on `esp_psram`.

The test dependencies are listed by `pytest_tas.py`. Install them into the
active virtual environment when PyPI access is available:

```sh
python -m pip install pytest pytest-embedded-idf pytest-embedded-qemu
python -m pytest -q pytest_tas.py
```

## Configuration (menuconfig)

The portable way to open the config menu, on any machine, once the toolchain
is exported as above:

```sh
idf.py menuconfig
```

### VSCode SDK Configuration Editor

If the ESP-IDF extension's "SDK Configuration Editor" (GUI menuconfig) does
not open, it is almost always because `.vscode/settings.json`'s
`idf.currentSetup` does not match an installation known to the ESP-IDF
Installation Manager (`eim`) on this machine. That setting must hold an
**install ID** (e.g. `esp-idf-<hash>`), not a filesystem path — a path there
looks plausible but silently fails to resolve.

To fix it on any machine after installing ESP-IDF via `eim`:

```sh
cat ~/.espressif/tools/eim_idf.json
```

Copy the `idfSelectedId` value (or the `id` of the entry matching the ESP-IDF
version you want) into `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
"idf.currentSetup": "esp-idf-<hash-from-eim_idf.json>"
```

This ID is generated per machine by `eim`, so it will differ on every
computer — re-run this step after cloning the repo onto a new machine or
after reinstalling ESP-IDF. Reload the VSCode window afterwards.

`idf.port` in the same file is also machine-specific (the serial device path
of the connected board): `/dev/tty.usbmodem*` on macOS, `/dev/ttyUSB*` or
`/dev/ttyACM*` on Linux, `COM*` on Windows. Update it to match your board
before flashing or monitoring from VSCode.

## Debugging (OpenOCD)

The `gdbtarget` debug configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` has
`runOpenOCD` default to `true` (see the extension's `package.json`), so
**every** "Start Debugging" tries to spawn a fresh OpenOCD server. If a
previous session was force-stopped, crashed, or otherwise didn't shut its
OpenOCD process down cleanly, that old server keeps holding ports 3333
(GDB), 4444 (telnet) and 6666 (Tcl) — the new one then fails to bind them,
which is what "server already started" / can't-start-debug means.

`.vscode/launch.json`'s debug configuration now runs a `preLaunchTask`
("Reset OpenOCD", defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`) before every debug
session, which kills any leftover OpenOCD process first
(`pkill -f 'bin/openocd'` on macOS/Linux, `taskkill /IM openocd.exe` on
Windows) so the new one always gets a clean set of ports. If you ever need
to do this by hand instead: **Terminal → Run Task… → Reset OpenOCD**, or
directly:

```sh
pkill -f 'bin/openocd'    # macOS / Linux
```

### Debug launches an old binary / doesn't flash first

The `gdbtarget` `attach` config's `buildFlashMonitor` option (build, flash
and monitor before attaching) defaults to `false`. With it unset, clicking
Debug just attaches GDB via OpenOCD to **whatever is already on the
chip** — it does not build or flash your current source first. If the
serial log shown by a debug/monitor session doesn't match your code (e.g.
still shows the stock `hello_world` example, an old project name, or an old
compile timestamp in the `app_init:` banner lines — see
[Chip and firmware info logging](#chip-and-firmware-info-logging) below for
where to check that), this is almost always why: the board was never
actually reflashed with the current build, only attached to.

`.vscode/launch.json`'s debug configuration now sets `"buildFlashMonitor":
true`, so every Debug launch builds, flashes and monitors before attaching.
If you ever want to attach without reflashing (e.g. to inspect a crash
without touching the board's current state), temporarily set it back to
`false` for that session, or flash explicitly first instead:

```sh
idf.py -p PORT flash
```

## ESP32-S3 Hardware IO

The firmware pin definitions are kept in [tas_pins.h](main/tas_pins.h). GPIO
configuration and default power-up states are owned by
[PowerSupplies](main/power_supplies.cpp) and [Tas3251](main/tas3251.cpp) (see
[Firmware Architecture](#firmware-architecture)); the shared I2C master bus
(`I2C_NUM_0`, 400 kHz) is created by [I2cBus](main/i2c_bus.cpp).

| Signal | ESP32-S3 IO | Direction / interface | Purpose | Jumper needed |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------|---------|---------------|
| I2C SDA | IO0 | I2C data | Shared I2C data line for TAS3251 and optional ADAU1466 | No |
| I2C SCL | IO45 | I2C clock | Shared I2C clock line for TAS3251 and optional ADAU1466 | No |
| AMP RESET | IO42 | GPIO output | Releases or holds the TAS3251 in reset; active low | Yes — U14 pins 5-6 (IO42 to TAS_RESET) |
| DAC MUTE | IO1 | GPIO output | Hardware mute control for the TAS3251; active low | Yes — U14 pins 1-2 (IO1 to TAS_MUTE) |
| AMP FAULT | IO41 | GPIO input / interrupt | Receives latched TAS3251 fault indications | Yes — U14 pins 7-8 (IO41 to TAS_FAULT) |
| AMP CLIP/OTW | IO2 | GPIO input / interrupt | Receives clipping or over-temperature warning indications | Yes — U14 pins 3-4 (IO2 to TAS_CLIP) |
| AMP ADDRESS | IO12 | GPIO input | Reads the TAS3251 ADR strap state for I2C address selection | Yes — H2 pins 13-14 (TAS_ADR to ESP_TAS_ADR) |
| GOOD 13.2V | IO39 | GPIO input | Confirms that the 13.2 V intermediate rail is ready through jumper U15 | Yes — U15 pins 5-6 (IO39 to GOOD_13.2V) |
| ENABLE 12V | IO38 | GPIO output | Enables the 12 V GVDD analog supply after 13.2 V is good through jumper U15 | Yes — U15 pins 7-8 (IO38 to ENABLE_12V) |
| ENABLE 3.3V analog | IO40 | GPIO output | Enables the isolated 3.3 V analog rail for TAS3251 DAC_AVDD | Yes — U15 pins 3-4 (IO40 to ENABLE_3.3V) |
| STATUS LED SDI | IO8 | GPIO output (bit-banged) | SK9822 data into U8 SDI via R18 | V1.0/V1.1: rework, see [V1.0 checklist](#hardware-v10-checklist-before-first-power-up). V1.2: no |
| STATUS LED CKI | IO9 | GPIO output (bit-banged) | SK9822 clock into U8 CKI via R17 | V1.0/V1.1: rework, see [V1.0 checklist](#hardware-v10-checklist-before-first-power-up). V1.2: no |

Header U14 (2x4, 2.54 mm) carries the amplifier control/status lines between
the ESP32-S3 and the TAS3251, and header U15 (2x4, 2.54 mm) carries the power
sequencing lines between the ESP32-S3 and the rail-good/enable signals; on
both, each ESP32-S3 GPIO net and its counterpart signal are broken out to
adjacent pins in the same column so that a 2-pin shunt bridges them. Header
H2 (2x12) is the main board-to-board connector, and only its pins 13-14 need
a jumper to route the TAS3251 ADR strap to the ESP32-S3. None of these
headers ship with shunts populated by default, so populate the pin pairs
above per the current firmware pin mapping in [tas_pins.h](main/tas_pins.h)
before relying on these signals; per the netlist
(`Netlist_Class_D_amp_2026-07-23.enet` at the repository root), leaving a
pair open floats that signal instead of connecting it.

As the very first action of `SystemController::startup()` (`Tas3251::assertSafeState()`,
also called again as part of `Tas3251::init()`'s own GPIO configuration),
RESET_AMP and DAC_MUTE are driven to their safe defaults — reset asserted,
muted, together, since both are active low — before any other peripheral is
touched; both the 12 V and 3.3 V analog rails start disabled. `startup()`
then runs the sequence in [Firmware Architecture](#firmware-architecture) to
bring everything up in order. The I2C lines rely on the board-level 6.8 kOhm
pull-ups.

### Reserved pins (do not use)

| Module pin | ESP32-S3 IO | Reserved for | HW V1.0/V1.1 (wrong) | HW V1.2 |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| 28 | IO35 | Octal PSRAM (internal, N8R8) | SW2 + C51 (100 nF) to GND, TP12 | Not connected (SW2 → IO10, R51 pull-up) |
| 29 | IO36 | Octal PSRAM (internal, N8R8) | R18 → `L_SDI` (status LED data) | Not connected (`L_SDI` ← IO8) |
| 30 | IO37 | Octal PSRAM (internal, N8R8) | R17 → `L_CKI` (status LED clock) | Not connected (`L_CKI` ← IO9) |
| 13 / 14 | IO19 / IO20 | USB D− / D+ (native USB-Serial-JTAG) | R16 / R15 → USB-C | unchanged |
| 36 / 37 | RXD0 / TXD0 | UART0 console / ROM download | H2 pin 5 / H2 pin 3 | unchanged |

`tas_pins.h` contains a `static_assert` that fails the build if any pin
macro is set to IO35-IO37 while `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MODE_OCT` is enabled.

Strapping pins IO0 (I2C SDA, 6.8 kΩ pull-up → normal SPI boot), IO3 and
IO46 (H2 pins 4/6) also need care. Do not load them in a way that changes
their level at reset.

### Key SW configuration (`sdkconfig.defaults`)

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_8MB` | `y` | N8R8 has 8 MB (Quad) flash |
| `CONFIG_SPIRAM` | `y` | Enable the 8 MB PSRAM |
| `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MODE_OCT` | `y` | N8R8 PSRAM is **Octal**. Quad mode fails PSRAM init. This mode is why IO35-IO37 are reserved |
| `CONFIG_SPIRAM_SPEED_80M` | `y` | Max reliable PSRAM clock for this module |
| `MINIMAL_BUILD` (root `CMakeLists.txt`) | `ON` | `esp_psram` must stay in `main`'s `PRIV_REQUIRES`, or `CONFIG_SPIRAM` disappears |

## Potential DSP (ADAU1466) Connectivity

The board breaks out a DSP interface on connector U10 (1x6, 2.54 mm) for a
future ADAU1466 DSP module. RESET and SELFBOOT are direct GPIO connections;
the I2C lines join the shared TAS3251 bus through 22 Ohm series resistors
rather than a separate bus.

| Signal | ESP32-S3 IO | U10 pin | Direction / interface | Purpose | Jumper needed |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------------------|---------|---------------|
| DSP_RESET | IO47 | 3 | GPIO output | Resets the ADAU1466 DSP | No |
| DSP_SELFBOOT | IO48 | 6 | GPIO output | Sets the ADAU1466 self-boot mode strap | No |
| DSP SDA | IO0 | 4 | I2C data | Joins the shared I2C data line via 22 Ohm series resistor R19 | No |
| DSP SCL | IO45 | 5 | I2C clock | Joins the shared I2C clock line via 22 Ohm series resistor R20 | No |

U10 pins 1 and 2 carry GND and 3.3V respectively for powering the DSP module.

## Firmware Architecture

The firmware is C++ (`gnu++26`, exceptions and RTTI disabled per
`sdkconfig`, matching the rest of ESP-IDF). Each hardware concern is owned by
one class; `tas_pins.h` remains the single source of truth for GPIO numbers.

| Class | Files | Owns |
|-------|-------|------|
| `tas::I2cBus` | [i2c_bus.hpp](main/i2c_bus.hpp) / [.cpp](main/i2c_bus.cpp) | The shared I2C master bus (SDA/SCL), device attach/probe |
| `tas::Tas3251` | [tas3251.hpp](main/tas3251.hpp) / [.cpp](main/tas3251.cpp) | RESET_AMP, DAC_MUTE, /FAULT + /CLIP_OTW IRQs, AMP ADDRESS strap, book/page I2C register access |
| `tas::Dsp` | [dsp_adau1466.hpp](main/dsp_adau1466.hpp) / [.cpp](main/dsp_adau1466.cpp) | DSP_RESET, DSP_SELFBOOT, I2C presence probe for the optional ADAU1466 |
| `tas::PowerSupplies` | [power_supplies.hpp](main/power_supplies.hpp) / [.cpp](main/power_supplies.cpp) | GOOD_13.2V sense, ENABLE_12V, ENABLE_3.3V analog |
| `tas::I2sBus` | [i2s_bus.hpp](main/i2s_bus.hpp) / [.cpp](main/i2s_bus.cpp) | ESP-IDF I2S std-mode TX channel for the shared TAS3251/DSP audio bus |
| `tas::StatusLed` | [status_led.hpp](main/status_led.hpp) / [.cpp](main/status_led.cpp) | Bit-banged SK9822 (APA102-compatible) driver for the U8/U9 status LED chain |
| `tas::SystemController` | [system_controller.hpp](main/system_controller.hpp) / [.cpp](main/system_controller.cpp) | Startup sequencing, fault/clip handling, and the steady-state monitor loop, composing the classes above |

`main/tas_main.cpp` (`app_main`) only constructs a `SystemController` and
calls `startup()` then `runForever()`.

⚠️ **`I2sPins` in `i2s_bus.hpp` has no wired GPIOs on the current board.**
Per `Netlist_Class_D_amp_2026-07-23.enet` (repository root), connector U11
(MCLK/LRCK/SCLK/SDIN) only reaches the TAS3251 — the ESP32-S3 has no *PCB*
net in common with the I2S bus on this revision, despite the top-level
README's "ESP32-S3 directly (for testing/streaming)" bullet. `I2sBus` is a
working scaffold for a future revision (or rework) that does wire it up; it
isn't used by `SystemController` yet. See
[I2S Test Tone (H2-to-U11 Patch)](#i2s-test-tone-h2-to-u11-patch) below for a
way to exercise it today with a manual patch instead of a board respin.

### Startup sequence

`SystemController::startup()` runs the following states, logging each
transition at `ESP_LOGI` and any failure at `ESP_LOGE` (aborting the sequence
on failure, leaving the amplifier held in reset and muted):

```
AMP_RESET               → RESET_AMP asserted, DAC_MUTE asserted together (both active low),
                           as the very first action of startup(), before any other peripheral
INIT                    → status LED (blue), I2C bus, GPIOs, /FAULT + /CLIP_OTW IRQs, DSP probe
WAIT_POWER_STABLE       → 2 ms delay (see ⚠️ below)
CHECK_13V2              → poll GOOD_13.2V; abort if not good
ENABLE_12V              → enable the 12V GVDD analog rail
ENABLE_3V3_ANALOG       → enable the 3.3V analog (DAC_AVDD) rail
WAIT_PRE_RESET_RELEASE  → 5 ms delay (see ⚠️ below)
MUTE_I2C                → mute both DACs over I2C (B0-P0-R3, bit0 left + bit4 right) —
                           RESET_AMP is still asserted at this point
CONFIGURE               → placeholder for DSP config (EQ/crossover) and volume setup —
                           not implemented yet, see ⚠️ below
DSP_STANDBY             → bring the DSP out of standby (B0-P0-R2 DEVICE_CTRL_2, bit7 DSPR = 1)
WAIT_BEFORE_UNMUTE      → 200 ms delay
UNMUTE                  → DAC_MUTE released
WAIT_BEFORE_RESET_RELEASE → 205 ms delay
RELEASE_RESET           → RESET_AMP released, audio path active
READY                   → status LED (green), hand off to runForever()
```

Any failure along the way aborts the sequence, sets `SystemController::status()`
to `StartupFailed`, and turns the status LED amber (see
[Status LED (U8/U9)](#status-led-u8u9) below) — the amplifier stays held in
reset and muted.

`SystemController::runForever()` then polls `/FAULT`, `/CLIP_OTW` and
GOOD_13.2V every 50 ms, logging state changes and reacting to `/FAULT` and
`/CLIP_OTW` as described in [Status LED (U8/U9)](#status-led-u8u9).

⚠️ **Open questions carried over from architecture review, marked `TODO` in
the code (`system_controller.cpp`, `tas3251.hpp`) — verify against the actual
TAS3251 datasheet before trusting them in the field:**

- The 2 ms `WAIT_POWER_STABLE`, 5 ms `WAIT_PRE_RESET_RELEASE`, 200 ms
  `WAIT_BEFORE_UNMUTE` and 205 ms `WAIT_BEFORE_RESET_RELEASE` delays come
  from the hardware bring-up spec. If `GOOD_13.2V` already guarantees the
  rails have settled, `WAIT_POWER_STABLE` may be unnecessary.
- Whether the 3.3V analog (AVDD) rail must be enabled a fixed time
  before/after the 12V (GVDD) rail, rather than immediately after it as
  implemented, is unconfirmed.
- `CONFIGURE` (DSP config / volume setup) is a placeholder today —
  `SystemController::startup()` does not write any EQ/crossover coefficients
  or set a startup volume between muting the DACs and bringing the DSP out
  of standby. `Tas3251::setVolumeDb()`'s dB-to-register-code formula also
  follows a common TI PurePath convention but is **unverified for TAS3251
  specifically** — confirm against the datasheet before writing arbitrary
  volumes in the field.
- `Dsp`'s placeholder I2C address (`0x38`) is unconfirmed; harmless today
  since no board has the ADAU1466 populated.

### Status LED (U8/U9)

U8 and U9 are SK9822 (APA102-compatible) addressable RGB LEDs, chained in
series and driven from the ESP32-S3 over a bit-banged two-wire link:
IO8 → `L_SDI` (data, into U8) and IO9 → `L_CKI` (clock); U8's
CKO/SDO feed U9's CKI/SDI. HW V1.0/V1.1 drove these from IO36/IO37 through
R18/R17, which collides with the Octal PSRAM. On those boards the LEDs only
work after the [V1.0 rework](#hardware-v10-checklist-before-first-power-up).
HW V1.2 routes IO8/IO9 directly. This is **not** a WS2812B (single-wire) — see the
correction in the top-level [README.md](../README.md#visual-indicators).
`tas::StatusLed` treats the chain as two independently-addressable LEDs and
gives them different jobs:

- **LED 0 (U8) — persistent `SystemController::Status`:**

  | Status | Color | Meaning |
  |--------|-------|---------|
  | `Booting` | Blue | `startup()` is running |
  | `Ready` | Green | Startup succeeded; amp unmuted, nominal volume |
  | `Fault` | Red | `/FAULT` latched; amp muted at low volume (see below) |
  | `StartupFailed` | Amber | `startup()` aborted before reaching `Ready` |

- **LED 1 (U9) — transient `/CLIP_OTW` indicator:** off normally; flashes
  amber for ~120 ms each time `/CLIP_OTW` fires, then returns to off. Purely
  a visual cue — it does not reflect or change `Status`.

**Fault vs. clip handling** (`SystemController::handleFault()` /
`handleClipOtw()`, called from `runForever()`):

- **`/FAULT`**: logs the latched fault bytes (B0-P0-R94/R95), re-asserts
  `DAC_MUTE` and sets both channels to the same conservative low volume used
  at startup, sets `Status` to `Fault` (LED 0 red), and **stays there** —
  there's no automatic recovery yet (see the `TODO` in
  `SystemController::handleFault()` and the existing "Fault Handling"
  section in the top-level README for the intended recovery policy: wait for
  thermal recovery, then toggle `RESET_AMP`).
- **`/CLIP_OTW`**: logs only (`ESP_LOGW`) and flashes LED 1 — no mute, no
  volume change, no `Status` change. This is a deliberate design choice:
  clipping is common/non-latching and shouldn't itself silence the amp,
  unlike a real `/FAULT`.

### Chip and firmware info logging

Before the `INIT` state, `startup()` logs everything readily available about
the running chip and firmware image at `ESP_LOGI`: target/core
count/silicon revision/radio features, flash size and type, WiFi-STA MAC
address, current and minimum-ever free heap, the firmware's project
name/version/build timestamp/ESP-IDF version (from `esp_app_get_description()`,
i.e. this project's actual name/version, not a stale one), and the reason
for the last reset (power-on, software, watchdog, brownout, etc.). This is
the first thing to check in a serial capture — the project name and compile
timestamp there is the ground truth for what's actually running on the
board, e.g. if it still says `hello_world` instead of `tas`, the board was
never flashed with this project's build; see
[Debug launches an old binary / doesn't flash first](#debug-launches-an-old-binary--doesnt-flash-first)
above.

### Generating documentation

All classes are commented for Doxygen (`@file`/`@brief`/`@param`/`@return`/
`@note`/`@warning`). Generate HTML docs from the `tas/` directory:

```sh
doxygen Doxyfile
open docs/html/index.html
```

## I2S Test Tone (H2-to-U11 Patch)

**Status: proposed / not yet implemented in firmware.** This is a bring-up
idea for exercising the audio path without a board respin, recorded here
before writing the code.

Connector H2 (2x12, the main board-to-board header) breaks out several
ESP32-S3 GPIOs that this firmware does not otherwise use. Checked against
`Netlist_Class_D_amp_2026-07-23.enet`, the following H2 pins are genuinely
spare (not assigned to any signal in [ESP32-S3 Hardware IO](#esp32-s3-hardware-io)
or [Potential DSP (ADAU1466) Connectivity](#potential-dsp-adau1466-connectivity)):

| H2 pin | ESP32-S3 IO | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| 16 | IO13 | free |
| 18 | IO14 | free |

Since connector U11 (the I2S input header, see
[Firmware Architecture](#firmware-architecture) above) only reaches the
TAS3251 and nothing else drives it, a user-installed patch from four of the
free H2 pins to U11 lets the ESP32-S3 act as a temporary I2S source for the
amplifier — no board respin needed:

| U11 pin | Signal | Patch to H2 pin | ESP32-S3 IO |
|---------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| 4 | LRCK (WS) | 18 | IO14 |
| 5 | SCLK (BCLK) | 16 | IO13 |
| 6 | SDIN (DOUT, ESP32 → TAS3251) | 20 | IO21 |
| 3 | MCLK | 12 | IO11 |
| 1 | GND | any H2 GND pin (15/17/19/21-24) | — |

⚠️ **Do not patch H2 to U11 while a DIR9001 module (or anything else) is also
connected to U11** — the ESP32-S3 would then be driving LRCK/SCLK/SDIN into
whatever else is driving those same lines.

### Planned firmware behavior

Once implemented: 5 seconds after `SystemController::startup()` reaches the
`READY` state (i.e. after the amplifier is configured and unmuted), the
firmware logs a new state (e.g. `TEST_TONE_START`) and starts writing a
continuous 1 kHz sine wave to both channels via `I2sBus::writeSamples()` —
same 16-bit/48 kHz stereo interleaved format `I2sBus` already assumes. This
would likely live in a small new class (e.g. `TestToneGenerator`) that owns
the sample buffer and reuses `I2sBus` rather than being folded into
`SystemController` directly, so it can be compiled out entirely once no
longer needed for bring-up.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate via [Configuration (menuconfig)](#configuration-menuconfig), and try again.


### Hardware V1.0 checklist (before first power-up)

V1.0 boards have two hardware faults:

- **USB-C rotated 180°** (V1.0 only, fixed in V1.1). There is no USB power,
  no native USB flashing and no JTAG.
- **IO35/IO36/IO37 (module pins 28/29/30) used on an N8R8 module** (V1.0
  *and* V1.1, fixed in V1.2). These pins belong to the internal Octal PSRAM.
  SW2/C51 sit on IO35, and the SK9822 status LEDs hang off IO36/IO37 through
  R18/R17. The C51 load and any GPIO drive on these pins corrupt PSRAM and
  crash the firmware.

Do all of the steps below **before connecting the 36 V supply**. On V1.1,
do sections A and B, then flash over USB-C instead of section C.

#### A. Rework (soldering iron, board unpowered)

1. **Remove C51** (100 nF, across SW2). It loads the IO35 PSRAM line.
2. **SW2: remove it, or never press it.** Pressing it shorts a PSRAM line to
   GND and crashes the ESP32. SW2 has no firmware function on V1.0/V1.1.
3. **Remove R18 and R17** (27 Ω, 0402). This frees IO36/IO37 from the LED
   lines.
4. **Bodge the status LEDs to IO8/IO9** (the pins the firmware now uses):
   - H2 pin 7 (IO8) → R18 pad on the `L_SDI` side (continuity to U8 pin 1, SDI)
   - H2 pin 8 (IO9) → R17 pad on the `L_CKI` side (continuity to U8 pin 2, CKI)

   Use the pad that beeps to U8, **not** the one that beeps to the ESP32
   module (pins 29/30). Use short, thin wire (e.g. 30 AWG). This step is
   optional: if you skip it, the firmware still runs, but the status LEDs
   stay dark.
5. **Continuity check:**
   - No connection between H2 pin 7/8 and module pins 29/30.
   - No short between H2 pins 7 and 8.
   - No short from either pin to GND or 3.3V.
   - Nothing else is connected to H2 pins 7/8. They now carry the LED bus.

#### B. Shunts / jumpers

| Header | Pins | Connects | Needed for |
|--------|------|----------|------------|
| U14 | 1-2 | IO1 ↔ TAS_MUTE | DAC_MUTE control |
| U14 | 3-4 | IO2 ↔ TAS_CLIP | /CLIP_OTW sense |
| U14 | 5-6 | IO42 ↔ TAS_RESET | RESET_AMP control |
| U14 | 7-8 | IO41 ↔ TAS_FAULT | /FAULT sense |
| U15 | 3-4 | IO40 ↔ ENABLE_3.3V | 3.3 V analog rail enable |
| U15 | 5-6 | IO39 ↔ GOOD_13.2V | 13.2 V good sense |
| U15 | 7-8 | IO38 ↔ ENABLE_12V | 12 V GVDD enable |
| H2 | 13-14 | TAS_ADR ↔ IO12 | I2C address strap read |
| U13 | 3-4 (exactly one pair) | FREQ_ADJ → 10 kΩ | 768 kHz PWM (default, see top-level README) |

#### C. Flash the firmware first, without 36 V

6. **Rebuild with Octal PSRAM.** Delete the old `sdkconfig` and run
   `idf.py reconfigure build`. Check that `grep SPIRAM_MODE sdkconfig` shows
   `CONFIG_SPIRAM_MODE_OCT=y`.
7. **Power the digital side only.** Connect a 5 V bench supply with a
   ~300 mA current limit: + to **H2 pin 1** (+5V), − to H2 pin 15/17/19/21-24
   (GND).
   - +5V feeds the AP63203 3.3 V buck directly, and D5 blocks back-feed into
     the 36 V buck.
   - This is the same state as the intended USB-C programming mode, so the
     TAS3251 output stage stays unpowered.
   - Alternative: power from the main 36 V input as before, but only after
     sections A and B are done.
8. **Wire a 3.3 V-logic UART adapter:**
   - adapter TXD → H2 pin 5 (RXD0)
   - adapter RXD → H2 pin 3 (TXD0)
   - adapter GND → any H2 GND pin

   Do not connect the adapter's 3.3 V/5 V output.
9. **Enter the ROM bootloader:**
   1. Jumper U10 pin 4 to U10 pin 1 (IO0 → GND).
   2. Press and release SW1 (EN/reset).
   3. Wait ~200 ms, then remove the IO0 jumper.

   The chip now waits in the UART download bootloader on UART0.
10. **Flash:**

    ```sh
    idf.py -p /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXX flash monitor
    ```

    - To find the port, run `ls /dev/tty.*` before and after plugging in
      the adapter.
    - esptool's DTR/RTS reset pulses fail silently because nothing is wired
      to them. That's fine, since the chip is already in the bootloader.
    - In VS Code, set `idf.port` to this device and `idf.flashType` to
      `"UART"` in `.vscode/settings.json`.
11. **Boot and check the log.** Press SW1 again (IO0 not grounded) and check
    the monitor output at 115200:
    - You should see `esp_psram: Found 8MB PSRAM device`.
    - The status LED (if reworked) goes blue, then amber, because
      GOOD_13.2V is absent without 36 V. That is expected.
    - If PSRAM init fails or the chip reboots in a loop, recheck step 6 and
      section A.

#### D. First 36 V power-up

12. Remove the 5 V bench supply from H2 pin 1 and keep the UART monitor
    connected.
13. Apply 36 V from a current-limited supply for the first power-up.
    Expected result:
    - LED 0 goes blue → green.
    - The red D_FAULT LED stays off.
    - The log walks through the startup states to `READY`.

One limit remains on V1.0: live JTAG debugging (the gdbtarget launch config)
goes over the broken USB-C native-USB-JTAG peripheral, so it is unavailable
on V1.0 boards.
